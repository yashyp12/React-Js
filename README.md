# Why React?
- We can use states which means that once we update the state variable, it changes across the page
- We can split our app into multiple components and reuse those components
- React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI which is better than updating content using DOM Manipulation
- Debugging and maintainance is easy



- we can pass the data using props - 
import React from 'react'
import Footer from './Footer'

<!-- 
const Navbar = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
<div className="logo">{props.logoText}</div>
      this is  navbar
      <Footer/>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Navbar -->


# RULES 
- IN REACT THE COMPONENT NAME SHOULD BE STARTS WITH UPPPER CASE LETTER
